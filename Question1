Write an SQL query to get the second highest salary from an Employee table. For
example, given the Employee table below, the query should return 200 as the second
highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1 | 100 |
| 2 | 200 |
| 3 | 300 |
+----+--------+

SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);
